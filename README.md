# RockPaper
Write a program that plays 100 iterations of Rock, Paper, Scissors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors). 
One player should always play randomly, the other should always choose rock. It should show at the end how many games each player has won and how many were a draw.

The code should have high test coverage.
